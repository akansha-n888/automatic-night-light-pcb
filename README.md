## Motivation
I grew out of using night lights; my niece on the other hand loves them. I decided that I would buy her one but I didn't like too many of the designs. So I figured that I make my own (or at least try). The first step of my design process starts with a PCB design of a simple night light circuit (available in the Schematic Editor document).
